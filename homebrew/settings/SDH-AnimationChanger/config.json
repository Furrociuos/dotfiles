She adores Zelda and I was surprised to see no one had made something like this. So, I took it upon myself to make one. I forgot how much I enjoy making motion graphics.\n\nNote: I forgot to set the project to 60 FPS, so, unfortunately this is 24 FPS. To make it 60, I'd have to do the whole thing again from scratch due to technical reasons. Having said that, I actually think the 24 FPS looks pretty good. But, if there's enough demand/downloads, I'll make an update.\n\nFeel free to message me\n\n* Steam: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/A\\_Metal\\_Penguin](https://steamcommunity.com/id/A_Metal_Penguin)\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AMetalPenguin](https://twitter.com/AMetalPenguin)\n\n>Software used: Davinci Resolve | Photoshop\n\n***If you enjoy this and aren't too busy, please leave a like and share with your friends!*** \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\n\n\\~\ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udc27",
